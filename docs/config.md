# Jellyswarrm Configuration Documentation  

Jellyswarrm stores its configuration in a **TOML** file located at:  
`./data/jellyswarrm.toml` (inside the container).  

The SQLite database is stored at:  
`./data/jellyswarrm.db`.  

To persist your configuration and database across container restarts, mount a volume to the `./data` directory.  

You can override the default configuration in two ways:  
1. Provide your own `jellyswarrm.toml` file and mount it into the container.  
2. Use environment variables to override individual settings.

## Configuration Options  

The table below lists all available configuration options:  

| Variable | Default Value | Environment Key | Description |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `server_id` | *Generated UUID (32 hex chars)* | `JELLYSWARRM_SERVER_ID` | Unique identifier for the proxy server instance. |
| `public_address` | `localhost:3000` | `JELLYSWARRM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` | Public address where the proxy is accessible. |
| `server_name` | `Jellyswarrm Proxy` | `JELLYSWARRM_SERVER_NAME` | Display name for the proxy server. |
| `host` | `0.0.0.0` | `JELLYSWARRM_HOST` | Host address the server binds to. |
| `port` | `3000` | `JELLYSWARRM_PORT` | Port number for the proxy server. |
| `include_server_name_in_media` | `true` | `JELLYSWARRM_INCLUDE_SERVER_NAME_IN_MEDIA` | Append the server name to media titles in responses. |
| `username` | `admin` | `JELLYSWARRM_USERNAME` | Default admin username. |
| `password` | `jellyswarrm` | `JELLYSWARRM_PASSWORD` | Default admin password (⚠️ change this in production). |
| `session_key` | *Generated 64-byte key* | `JELLYSWARRM_SESSION_KEY` | Base64-encoded session encryption key. |
| `timeout` | `20` | `JELLYSWARRM_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout in seconds. |
| `preconfigured_servers` | `[]` | `JELLYSWARRM_PRECONFIGURED_SERVERS` | Optional list of preconfigured Jellyfin servers (`url`, `name`, `priority`, `media_streaming_mode`). |
| `ui_route` | `ui` | `JELLYSWARRM_UI_ROUTE` | URL path segment for accessing the web UI (e.g., `/ui`). |
| `url_prefix` | *(none)* | `JELLYSWARRM_URL_PREFIX` | Optional URL prefix for all routes (useful for reverse proxy setups). |
| `server_background_check_interval_secs` | `30` | `JELLYSWARRM_SERVER_BACKGROUND_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS` | Interval in seconds for background server health checks. |
| `auto_create_users_on_login` | `true` | `JELLYSWARRM_AUTO_CREATE_USERS_ON_LOGIN` | Automatically create local users on successful upstream login. |
| `merge_libraries` | `true` | `JELLYSWARRM_MERGE_LIBRARIES` | Merge libraries with matching names across servers into virtual libraries. |
| `deduplicate_media` | `false` | `JELLYSWARRM_DEDUPLICATE_MEDIA` | Collapse the same movie or show (series/season/episode) on multiple servers into one item whose versions are served by the different hosts (Jellyfin-style linked versions; Jellyfin v12 adds multi-versions for episodes). Legacy key `deduplicate_movies` / env `JELLYSWARRM_DEDUPLICATE_MOVIES` still loads. |

### Notes
- The `session_key` is generated as a secure 64-byte key if not specified, and is stored in the config file for reuse.  
- Each server now has its own streaming mode (`Redirect` or `Proxy`). For preconfigured servers, omit `media_streaming_mode` to use the default `Redirect`.
- Configuration files are resolved from the data directory (`./data` by default), which can be overridden with `JELLYSWARRM_DATA_DIR`.

## Single sign-on (OpenID Connect)

The web UI can additionally log in through an OpenID Connect provider (authorization code flow with PKCE). Add an `[oidc]` section to `jellyswarrm.toml`:

```toml
[oidc]
issuer_url = "https://auth.example.com"
client_id = "jellyswarrm"
client_secret = "..."            # omit for a public client
redirect_url = "https://jellyswarrm.example.com/ui/oidc/callback"
admin_group = "jellyswarrm-admins" # optional
```

- Register `redirect_url` exactly as written at the provider; it is not derived from the request, so a TLS-terminating proxy cannot change its scheme. The path is `/<ui_route>/oidc/callback` (with `url_prefix` in front if one is set).
- The scopes `openid groups` are requested. Members of `admin_group` (from the `groups` claim) log in as the admin. Everyone else logs in to the Jellyswarrm account they have **linked**: sign in once with the account's password, open **Profile → Link single sign-on** and complete the provider login. The link stores the provider's issuer and subject, never a username, so renaming an account at the provider cannot redirect a login to someone else's account. No accounts are created; users get their Jellyswarrm account as before, by logging in once from a Jellyfin client.
- Native Jellyfin apps cannot follow a browser login. They sign in with Quick Connect instead: pick "Quick Connect" in the app, then enter the code under **Quick Connect** in the web UI after signing in there. The device is logged in with the servers connected to that account. The admin account has no media access and cannot approve codes.
